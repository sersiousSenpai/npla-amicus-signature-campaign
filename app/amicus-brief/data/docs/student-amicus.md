## INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE

_Amici_ are law students and law student organizations from law schools across the United
States.^1 They are diverse geographically, economically, socially, and politically. They study law
for different reasons. They will go on to represent a wide range of clients and causes. Ye t _amici_ are
united in one fundamental respect. They have dedicated themselves to the idea that we are a society
governed by laws, not by raw power. They recognize that the executive order attacks their chosen
profession. It attacks the values that cause law practice to be meaningful in American life. _Amici_
ask this Court to protect the legal profession they are preparing to join and the core values that the
profession serves.^2
**ARGUMENT**
The executive order at issue in this litigation (and similar executive orders) represent
government reprisal against law firms for taking up representations disfavored by those in control
of the executive branch of the government. As described by Plaintiff and other _amici_ , these orders
represent unacceptable intrusions on professional independence and the rule of law. They will
undermine the profession’s bedrock principles and ethics. They will reduce the opportunities that
law practice provides. Unless enjoined by the Court, the orders will cause enduring damage to the
legal profession and _amici_ as America’s future lawyers.
Our society has functioned for centuries on the understanding that lawyers are free and
even encouraged to take up disfavored representations, that every person deserves due process and

_Amici_ certify that this brief was authored entirely by counsel for _amici curiae_ and not by counsel
for any party, in whole or in part; that no party or counsel for any party contributed money to fund
preparing or submitting this brief; and thatcontributed money to fund preparing or submitting this brief. , apart from counsel for _See_ Fed.R.App.P. 29(a)(4)(E). _amici curiae_ , no other person

their day in court. For just as long, young people have been called to the law to renew that promise
and to participate in America’s legal institutions. Like so many before them, _amici_ have expended
considerable money, time, and effort to join the legal profession. They have deprived themselves
of income from other possible employment. They have attended law school, studied difficult fields
of law, and learned principles of legal ethics. They have clerked for law firms and judges during
the summer and school year. They have planned for their future on the understanding that the legal
profession represents a valuable and honorable profession.
The executive order compromises the premise on which _amici_ have labored to become
lawyers. In the world envisioned by the executive order, any lawyer who undertakes a
representation disfavored by the executive branch of the government can be ruined through a
government-run blacklist. Lawyers who are associated with that lawyer because they work in the
same firm also can be ruined. This has serious implications for _amici_ as America’s future lawyers.
Under the fear-based system created by the executive order, law firms will be encouraged to
withdraw from or decline to undertake representations that are disfavored by the executive branch.
They will be encouraged to not articulate claims or defenses that are similarly disfavored. They
may be encouraged to entirely avoid representations adverse to the government. America’s legal
system has been one the country’s greatest assets; yet companies also may do less business in the
United States if weakened legal institutions expose them to greater risk. For these reasons and
more, in the world created by this executive order, there may be fewer opportunities for young
lawyers to work, learn, and grow. The practice of law also may become less professionally
satisfying and constrained by fewer economic opportunities.
Beyond that, _amici_ now must wonder whether their professional prospects will be harmed
by having accepted a clerkship with a particular judge or accepting a position with a particular law


(^3)
firm. Some _amici_ soon may learn that a future employer now avoids the meaningful work that
brought _amici_ to that firm in the first place. Others will be told they must undertake representations
solely to earn the executive branch’s approval. As emerging lawyers, _Amici_ are invited to walk into
an ethical minefield where they must be ready to reject representations or abandon clients to avoid
retribution. This is the opposite of what being a lawyer should represent. _Amici_ haven’t spent years
studying so they could genuflect to whomever happens to occupy the executive branch. They
signed up to be lawyers. They signed up to choose their clients, and vigorously represent their
clients, whomever the clients and their causes and claims may be.
Left alone, the executive order signals a transformation of our legal system. The rules don’t
matter anymore. Neither does due process. What matters is being in the good graces of those in
power. One might wonder whether law even will matter when _amici_ graduate. Which begs a
question: If law doesn’t matter, why should anyone become a lawyer in the first place?
**CONCLUSION**
The executive order is an affront to the legal profession and the rule of law. It threatens the
present and the future of the American legal profession. The Court should grant the relief sought
by Plaintiff.
