An amicus curiae brief is a legal document filed in appellate court cases by non-litigants with a strong interest in the subject matter. The term "amicus curiae" means "friend of the court."

Amicus briefs are often filed in cases of broad public interest and may bring relevant matter to the court's attention that the parties have not already addressed. These briefs can play an important role in appellate advocacy by supplementing the efforts of counsel and drawing the court's attention to law or arguments that might otherwise escape consideration.

Law students and legal organizations often participate in filing amicus briefs as it provides valuable experience in legal writing and advocacy. The process involves careful research, clear argumentation, and adherence to court rules and procedures.

The impact of amicus briefs can be significant, as they often provide specialized knowledge, point out the broader implications of a case, or show the potential impact of a court's decision on people or organizations beyond the immediate parties to the case.
